Convolutional autoencoder (CAE) is implemented on differences between exact (contaminated) and simplified (not contaminated) simulations and geometries of 2D electrostatic capacitors. To predict the locations of the contamination on expected difference images, CAD models of electrostatics capacitors are generated and then, simulated according to their features such as boundary conditions, relative permittivities of the materials and electrostatic equation. The network model works high accurately. Overfitting, however, occurs in all experiment results.
